2. Open terminal and make sure you had successfully install Python and had been added to path

	```
	> python3 --version

	# Make sure the output should be 3.6.* or 3.7.*
	```

	*If the python3 did not successfully added to path, look at [how to find your python directory](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/win/) and [how to set path](https://superuser.com/a/949577/747852). (For setting path, old method are much more easier as you can use GUI)*
